# LiteX Build Environment

[The LiteX Build Environment](https://github.com/timvideos/litex-buildenv)
is a tool for easily developing
[LiteX](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex) based systems. It was
originally designed to make the [TimVideos' HDMI2USB](https://hdmi2usb.tv) easy
to develop, but has now expanded to support multiple projects.

These include;
 * [TimVideos' HDMI2USB.tv System - Hardware for recording conferences and user groups](https://hdmi2usb.tv)
 * [FuPy - Running MicroPython on FPGA based systems](https://fupy.github.io)
 * NeTV2 System
 * Others...

 * Projects using LiteX Build Environment:
  * [HDMI2USB](http://hdmi2usb.tv/) - The HDMI2USB project develops affordable hardware options to record and stream HD videos (from HDMI & DisplayPort sources) for conferences, meetings and user groups.
  * [FuPy](https://fupy.github.io) - The aim of the FuPy project is to make MicroPython run on FPGAs using the LiteX & Migen+MiSoC technologies. This allows you to do full stack development (FPGA gateware & soft CPU firmware) in Python!
